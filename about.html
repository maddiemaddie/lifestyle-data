    <div class='section paragraph'><p>While reading Walmart's <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/walmart-privacy-policy">Privacy Policy,</a> I noticed that information about customers was used to make predictions based on products they might want. Instead of relying solely on these assumptions, customers deserve the option to directly tell Walmart exactly what they're looking for. This provides more information to Walmart about specific customer needs.<br><br><br>This system has many applications, which I tried to showcase in the three different use cases. Each one focuses on a particular lifestyle/interest, but every customer will have their own recommendations that are as unique as they are. <br><br><br>The more information a customer provides, the better their recommendations will be. After providing the initial information, they could be given the option to like or dislike the selected products, creating a truly personalized shopping experience. To protect privacy, this would be something a customer would have to opt into, with the option to change their preferences at any time. <br><br><br>As the world's largest retailer, Walmart is in a unique position with the infrastructure and inventory to provide the widest variety of products. A system like this would improve Walmart's customer service experience by catering directly to the customer.
    <br><br><br><strong>Everyone already knows Walmart provides the best prices, but what if Walmart could provide the best product recommendations too?</strong></p></div>
